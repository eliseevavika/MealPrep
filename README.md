## About The Project

SliceUp is my new Android app for planning meals for the whole week.
The main idea is to simplify the whole process of planning your meals - from creating a base with your favorite recipes, planning what you are going to cook for the whole week of just weekends, and finally, building an entire list of groceries to save time for shopping.
